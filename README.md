# PartyPlanner-Mahajan
AP Computer Science Project
//This program takes in a list of companies and names and assigns the people to different tables and seat numbers for an upcoming party where one person from each company sits at a table. This porgram also asks the user if they want to add any people to the names which it will also assign to a table. It checks that there arent more than ten people from a company and the attendees doesnt exceed 100 people.//
